# Uber trips visual analysis

Uber trips can be analyzed to reveal a variety of patterns, such as the busiest hour for Uber or which day has the most and least trips. The information I'm utilizing here is based on Uber rides from New York, a city with a large residential population and a very complicated transportation system.

Some conclusions from analysis:

- Uber's most profitable day is Monday.
- Fewer people use Uber on Saturdays.
- An increase in Uber trips often starts around 5 am.
- The busiest hour for Uber is about 6 p.m.
- Near the New York region of Manhattan, the majority of Uber rides start.
